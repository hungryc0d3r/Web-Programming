    <h2>The Institute: A Novel</h2>
    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <h5>A NEW YORK TIMES 100 NOTABLE BOOKS OF 2019 SELECTION</h5>

    <h5>
      From #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King, the most
      riveting and unforgettable story of kids confronting evil since It.
    </h5>

    <p>
      In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban
      Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him
      into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will
      wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except
      there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which
      are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to
      this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and
      ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke
      learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says.
      “You check in, but you don’t check out.”

    <p>
      In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and
      her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the
      force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go
      along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment
      is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more
      and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped
      from the Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid
      power of It, The Institute is Stephen King’s gut-wrenchingly dramatic
      story of good vs. evil in a world where the good guys don’t always win.
