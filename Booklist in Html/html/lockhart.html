        <h2>We Were Liars</h2>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>A beautiful and distinguished family.
            A private island.
            A brilliant, damaged girl; a passionate, political boy.
            A group of four friends—the Liars—whose friendship turns destructive.
            A revolution. An accident. A secret.
            Lies upon lies.
            True love.
            The truth.</p>
        <p>
            Read it.
            And if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.</p>

        <p><b>"Thrilling, beautiful, and blisteringly smart, We Were Liars is utterly unforgettable."</b>
            —John Green, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Fault in Our Stars</p>
